# Traffic Events Dataset
### Data Engineering Capstone Project

#### Project Summary
In this project, we implement an ETL process for a traffic events dataset via creating a star schema. Our schema enables data scientists to use the dataset stored in 
the data warehouse for purposes such as traffic analysis and prediction, impact prediction, accident prediction, routing engine optimization, travel time estimation.   
The project follows the follow steps:
* Step 1: Scope the Project and Gather Data
* Step 2: Explore and Assess the Data
* Step 3: Define the Data Model
* Step 4: Run ETL to Model the Data
* Step 5: Complete Project Write Up
